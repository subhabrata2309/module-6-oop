        "  Answer-\n",
        "  \n",
        "  OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which combine data (attributes) and methods (functions). It helps code to be reused , modular, and organized.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that it's objects (instances) will have.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It holds real values for the class's attributes and can use it's methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction : It hides the extra details and only focuses on what a function does. To use Abstraction we have to use the abstract module.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation : It the feature of OOP which allows us to hide data from unauthorized access. It focuses on how data is accessed and controlled and we do not need to import any module to use Encapsulation.\n",

        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (double underscore), like __init__, __str__, and __add__, are special methods used to define object behavior for built-in operations.\n",

        "\n",

        "Q7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows the same method name to behave differently based on the object (e.g., overridden methods in derived classes).\n",

        "\n",
        "Q8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is done by making attributes private (prefixing with __) and providing access through getters/setters.\n",

        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method __init__() used to initialize objects when they are created.\n",

        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, **class methods** are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance. They use the `@classmethod` decorator and take `cls` as the first parameter, allowing them to access or modify class-level variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, **static methods** are independent of both the class and instance. They use the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take `self` or `cls` as a parameter. Static methods are typically used for utility functions that relate to the class but don't need to access its data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-\n",
        "\n",
        "Python achieves similar behavior using default arguments, *args, or **kwargs to handle different numbers or types of arguments in a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "The method in the child class has the same name, parameters, and signature as the one in the parent class. This allows the child class to customize or completely replace the inherited behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a read-only attribute, allowing you to access it like a variable, while still executing a function behind the scenes. It is commonly used for encapsulation, where you want to control access to private attributes without changing how they’re accessed externally.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, enabling code flexibility, reusability, and scalability. It lets you use the same method name for different types, simplifying function and method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is used to define a common interface for its subclasses. It’s created using the abc module and must have at least one @abstractmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantages of Object Oriented programming are -\n",
        "1. **Modularity:**\n",
        "   Code is organized into classes and objects, thus it is easier to manage and maintain the code\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reusability:**\n",
        "   Classes can be reused across programs, and inheritance allows new classes to reuse existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "   Data and methods are bundled together, and access to sensitive data can be controlled using private/public attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction:**\n",
        "   Hides complex implementation details and exposes only essential features, making code easier to use and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism:**\n",
        "   The same method name can behave differently depending on the object, improving code flexibility and extensibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Scalability and Maintainability:**\n",
        "   OOP makes it easier to scale up complex programs and maintain them by separating concerns logically.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Real-World Mapping:**\n",
        "   Objects in code can represent real-world entities, making programs more intuitive and aligned with real-life modeling.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "A class variable is shared across all instances of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "An instance variable is unique to each object and is defined using self.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class, gaining attributes and methods from all.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",

        "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class, especially useful in inheritance to extend or override functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to perform cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "@staticmethod: Doesn't take self or cls, used for utility functions.\n",

        "Q23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses dynamic dispatch, so when a method is called on an object, it checks the actual class at runtime. If the method is overridden in the child class, that version is executed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line, by returning self from each method.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. You define it to make the object behave like a callable.\n",
